## PyMSA: Scoring Multiple Sequence Alignments with Python

PyMSA is an open source software tool aimed at providing a number of scores for
multiple sequence alignment (MSA) problems. This project is a development of the students of the
third course students of the degree on Bioinformatics of the E.T.S. de Ingeniería Informática 
of the University of Málaga.

## Requirements
PyMSA has been developed with Python 3.6.0 :: [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io) 4.3.0 (x86_64)

## Score
The scores that are currently available  are:
* Sum of pairs
* Star
* Minimum entropy
* Percentage of non-gaps code


## Downloading
To download PyMSA just clone the Git repository hosted in GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/ajnebro/pyMSAScoring.git
```
