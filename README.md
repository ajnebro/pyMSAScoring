## PyMSA: Scoring Multiple Sequence Alignments with Python

PyMSA is an open source software tool aimed at providing a number of scores for
multiple sequence alignment (MSA) problems. This project is a development of the students of the
third course students of the degree on Bioinformatics of the E.T.S. de Ingeniería Informática 
of the University of Málaga.

## Requirements
To use PyMSA the following software packages are required:
* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Score
The scores that are currently available  are:
* Sum of pairs
* Star
* Minimum entropy
* Percentage of non-gaps code
